Here is one of my university projects. This one is about using and analyzing two different algorithms for sorting numbers.

The program was sorting huge amounts of data with the "Selection Sort" algorithm and with the "Shell Sort" with the Hibbard 2^k - 1 sequence.

After a lot of testing and analyzing the performance of both algorithms, I came to the conclusion that Shell Sort is always faster than Selection Sort.

The difference in performance is getting bigger when we increase the number of numbers.

Shell sort is more effective in sorting many numbers due to a fewer number of switching operation amounts.

I also attached some files with randomly generated numbers that I used for testing.

Warning: If you don't have a strong computer, I suggest not using files with a huge amount of data.
